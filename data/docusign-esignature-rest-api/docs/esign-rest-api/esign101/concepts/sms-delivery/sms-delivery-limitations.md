# SMS and WhatsApp delivery notes and limitations

eSignature REST API 2.1 only

The following important notes and limitations apply to the [SMS and WhatsApp delivery](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/sms-delivery/) features.

## Limitations

- **SMS and WhatsApp message limits per envelope**: Only up to 50 SMS or WhatsApp messages can be sent per envelope. These notifications include all communications that ensure signers get the optimal experience, including requests to sign, reminders, expiration, completions, purges, comments, and more. Email notifications will continue to be sent after the 50 notification limit is met. The envelope details view will indicate that messages have been suspended due to the limit.
- **Maximum of 10 SMS and/or WhatsApp recipients per envelope**: The total number of delivery recipients is limited to 10.
- **Limited recipient types**: SMS or WhatsApp delivery can be applied to `signer`, `carbonCopy`, or `certifiedDelivery` (Needs to Sign, Needs to View, and Receives a Copy) recipients only.
- **SMS and WhatsApp document access**: When envelopes are delivered to SMS or WhatsApp only, the recipient will only have access to the documents via SMS or WhatsApp. In the future we will allow creation and tying of accounts to a phone number, at which time the envelope will automatically appear in the recipient's Docusign account.
- **Reminders**: While senders can specify any schedule for SMS or WhatsApp reminder messages, only up to one reminder notification can be sent (additional notifications will be email only). This limit protects signers from potential spam abuse.
- **Messages to recipients**: Sender-specified messages are not included in SMS or WhatsApp notifications. This includes the email message to all recipients and any private messages defined on the envelope or template. Messages are still included on the email notification and are shown when documents are opened to be viewed and signed.
- **Signing groups**: Signing group recipients cannot use SMS or WhatsApp delivery.
- **PowerForms**: SMS and WhatsApp delivery cannot be used with PowerForms.
- **Bulk send**: SMS and WhatsApp delivery cannot be used for bulk send recipients.

## Notes

- **SMS and WhatsApp delivery is available for remote eSignature scenarios**. Remote recipients can be notified via SMS, WhatsApp, email, both SMS and email, or both WhatsApp and email.
- **SMS and WhatsApp reminders and notifications will be sent out 24 hours after the initial message** or previous reminder, rather than at midnight.
- **Accounts with SMS or WhatsApp delivery have responsive signing enabled automatically.** This results in an improved signing experience on mobile devices.
